so where to begin?
some site testing with js disabled:

173 requests | 2.9MB transferred | Finish: 2.15s | DOMLoad: 859ms | Load: 2.11s

biggest area for improvement are as follows: for html/css
combining images to sprites and optimizing
cleaner page structure, get rid of the bloat
get rid of inline styles unless you change them later with js
condense styles into 1 stylesheet if possible
remove tons of inline js script that is everywhere (32kb worth!!!)


1. we are going to start by blocking out page structure into basic divs and give them names
from doing this block out, with php you can really think of each section as its own little module

so like news would be a module
then you would have dev blogs
top voted games
screenshots
so we could do something like
$this->load->view('module') in our controller
but this would also require us to hack up the html into pieces
but we really don't want to have to split up and start determining
the layout of the content such as controlling the col-s that divdes the main content
you wan tthis to be done on the front end reguardless of the backend stuff
its necessary separation

so we can have x moudles in a given section, then in view just load in
what modules we want in each section.
